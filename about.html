                <h1>Aria Oslo is a digital artist based in Portland, Oregon.</h1>
                <p>She focuses on juxtaposing portraiture with geometric abstraction, a nod to her first career as an architectural technician working on shaping cityscapes. Aria graduated from Oregon State University in 2012 with an art history degree, where she discovered her love for the Orphism art movement - her graduate project was a 3d puzzle and art piece titled Moving On. After deciding to go back to her art roots, Aria launched her 3d puzzle on Kickstarter in 2017 and left her day job. She now produces digital artwork for advertising, commissions and sells prints on her online shop, Orpheum.</p>
                <p>When Aria is not creating art, she's exploring the Pacific Northwest, reading mystery novels, and hosting board game nights. She can also be found mulling over all kinds of puzzle pieces, contemplating how it all fits together and how art imitates life (or is it the other way around?). </p>
